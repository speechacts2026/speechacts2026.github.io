  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    The workshop concerns a set of themes that crystallizes in linguistic research around the “performative hypothesis,” 
    which states that sentences carry a performative layer. In its original form, the syntactic representation of an utterance 
    S, produced by A and directed to B, includes a silent matrix such as [A tells B that S] (Ross 1970, Sadock 1974); more 
    recent versions propose that this matrix can be detected by its effects on mood and prosody, can be targeted by overt 
    operators like epistemics and evidentials, and can be addressed in discourse moves (Krifka 2015, 2025; Miyagawa 2012, 
    2022; Sauerland & Yatsushiro 2017; Wiltschko 2021; Trinh & Bassi 2023; Trinh 2024). Philosophers of language have 
    claimed that acts like “A tells B that S” can be delivered by A uttering the proposition-denoting S to B alone, together 
    with general communicative rules (Stenius 1967, Grice 1967, Stalnaker 1978). They also proposed that sentences can flag 
    the illocutionary force of sentences (Searle 1969).
  </p>

  <p>
    In our workshop, we plan to address two main questions: How grammatical features (e.g., clause typing, addressee encoding, 
    anchoring to discourse participants) affect the performative potential of sentences, and how the illocutionary force of 
    sentences can be derived from their context of use alone. More specifically, if silent performatives are present but not 
    semantically necessary, what observable footprints should they leave? Candidates include restrictions on embedding, 
    interactions with negation and modality, ellipsis and anaphora, response particles and tag questions, as well as repair 
    and self-correction phenomena in dialogue. We are especially interested in diagnostics that dissociate force, commitment, 
    and perspective, and that separate speaker/addressee features from propositional content.
  </p>

  <p>
    A second pillar of the workshop is crosslinguistic evidence. Languages differ in how they overtly mark clause type, 
    evidentiality, allocutivity, politeness, and discourse management; these systems offer natural experiments for the 
    performative hypothesis. We welcome fieldwork-based case studies, corpus-driven comparisons, and typological surveys 
    that probe whether—and how—silent performatives align with overt clause-peripheral morphology or particles, with 
    indexicals and deictics, or with prosodic contours. Methodologically, we welcome theoretical papers (syntax, semantics, 
    pragmatics, philosophy of language), experimental studies (psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, production/perception, 
    interaction), and corpus-based approaches. Ideal submissions connect the performative hypothesis to broader cognitive 
    theories of action representation, perspective taking, and common ground management.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to the general aims, the workshop explicitly solicits work on the following areas:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Metaquestions:</strong> Questions that target a prior speech act (echo, excursive, repetitive, and declarative questions). 
      For example, <em>You went where?</em> interrogates a commitment rather than add new descriptive content.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Speechact adverbials:</strong> Elements such as <em>again, honestly, briefly</em> that modify the act and reset 
      conversational state or signal sincerity conditions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Forms of address:</strong> Lexical and morphological means of encoding speaker/addressee relations, natural sites 
      for performative features such as [+author] and [+addressee].
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Discourse particles:</strong> Particles that package assumptions about common ground, evidence source, or speaker stance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Perspectives and deixis:</strong> Choices like <em>come vs. go</em>, <em>here vs. there</em> reveal the coordinates 
      of the speech situation and whose perspective is privileged.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By putting linguistic architecture in direct conversation with speech act theory, this workshop aims to sharpen our understanding 
    of how sentences become actions. We expect lively debate about whether silent performatives are explanatorily indispensable, 
    epiphenomenal, or strategically redundant—along with concrete proposals for how to detect, model, and explain them.
